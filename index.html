  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Application:</strong> Cleanup Crew<br>
     <strong>Operator:</strong> Sheehan CPA<br>
     <strong>Last updated:</strong> February 2026</p>

  <h2>1. What This Application Does</h2>
  <p>Cleanup Crew is a desktop application used internally to batch-import and manage
     categorized accounting transactions from Excel spreadsheets into QuickBooks
     Online on behalf of clients who have explicitly authorized access. It also
     supports querying and permanently deleting transactions from QuickBooks Online.</p>

  <h2>2. Data We Access</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>QuickBooks Online OAuth 2.0 access and refresh tokens obtained through
        Intuit's standard authorization flow.</li>
    <li>QuickBooks Online accounting data (chart of accounts, vendors, customers,
        transactions) necessary to validate, post, and manage records.</li>
    <li>Excel files provided manually by the operator — not uploaded anywhere.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How Data Is Stored</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>OAuth tokens are stored locally on the operator's machine only, optionally
        encrypted using Windows DPAPI.</li>
    <li>No financial data, transaction records, or client information is transmitted
        to any external or third-party server.</li>
    <li>No analytics, telemetry, or tracking of any kind is collected.</li>
    <li>Application logs are stored locally in the installation directory and are
        not transmitted anywhere.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Transaction Deletion</h2>
  <p>Cleanup Crew includes a Bulk Delete feature that allows permanently deleting
     transactions from QuickBooks Online by date range and type. Deletions are
     executed directly against the QuickBooks Online API using your authorized
     credentials. <strong>Deleted transactions cannot be recovered.</strong> The
     operator is solely responsible for ensuring deletions are intentional and
     authorized by the account holder.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, share, or disclose any data to third parties.
     The only external service this application communicates with is
     <strong>QuickBooks Online (Intuit Inc.)</strong>, using your authorized credentials.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Local token files can be deleted at any time by revoking access within the
     application or directly from your Intuit account at
     <a href="https://accounts.intuit.com">accounts.intuit.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>You may revoke this application's access to your QuickBooks data at any time
     through your Intuit account settings. Revoking access immediately invalidates
     all stored tokens.</p>

  <h2>8. Contact</h2>
  <p>For questions about this privacy policy, contact:<br>
